# XRAY/Graph

XRAY/Graph is a powerful infrastructure component within the XRAY/Network ecosystem, designed to streamline blockchain data access and enhance the performance of decentralized applications. It offers a distributed API service powered by XRAY/Network’s proprietary indexers, alongside well-established open-source tools such as Koios, Ogmios, Kupo, and others. This combination provides a high-performance backend capable of serving real-time, structured data from the Cardano blockchain.

By enabling fast and reliable access to on-chain information, XRAY/Graph supports a wide range of use cases for developers, dApps, and analytical tools. Users can query data related to wallet activity, token transfers, smart contract interactions, and key DeFi metrics with minimal latency. This not only improves dApp responsiveness but also fosters transparency and efficiency throughout the XRAY ecosystem.

To support various user needs, XRAY/Graph is available with both free and paid usage tiers, offering additional capacity, advanced features, and priority access. These paid plans can be conveniently purchased using ADA or XRAY tokens, making it flexible for developers and businesses building on Cardano.
