# XRAY/Network

XRAY/Network is an advanced open source ecosystem built for the Cardano blockchain platform, offering a comprehensive suite of products and tools designed to simplify blockchain interactions and unlock the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform empowers users to seamlessly engage in DeFi activities such as token swaps, staking, liquidity provision, and more — all within a secure and user-friendly environment designed to drive adoption and accessibility across the Cardano ecosystem.

## Key Components of the Ecosystem

- XRAY/App is designed to simplify blockchain interactions by providing a user-friendly interface that brings together
  essential tools for managing digital assets, DeFi, and staking on the Cardano blockchain. It offers a seamless
  experience for users of all levels, making it easier to participate in decentralized finance and interact with the
  broader ecosystem.

- A key feature of XRAY/App is its support for Mini Apps — modular, iframe-based applications that can be built and integrated by third-party developers. These Mini Apps allow for the addition of custom tools, services, and experiences within the platform, creating a flexible and extensible environment. This architecture empowers users, creators, liquidity providers, and traders to access a wide range of decentralized services all in one place.

- XRAY token is the native utility and governance token of the XRAY/Network ecosystem, serving as a core element that
  powers platform activities and user interactions. XRAY can be used for staking, allowing holders to earn rewards while
  supporting network security, and for participating in governance by voting on key proposals that shape the ecosystem’s
  future. Additionally, the token is utilized as a payment method for accessing XRAY/Network’s paid services, premium
  features, and advanced tools. This multi-functional role creates a strong utility loop, driving engagement and value
  creation as the ecosystem grows within the Cardano blockchain.

- XRAY/Vault app provides a secure transaction signing solution that enables users to remotely sign transactions via the
  XRAY/Vault app. Private keys remain safely stored on the user’s device, allowing secure remote approvals without
  exposing sensitive information — ideal for managing wallets, interacting with dApps, or supporting institutional
  operations.

- XRAY/Graph is a key part of the ecosystem, offering a distributed API service powered by XRAY/Network’s own indexers and
  open-source tools like Koios, Ogmios, Kupo, and others. It provides fast, real-time access to Cardano blockchain data,
  allowing developers and users to track transactions, wallet activity, smart contracts, and DeFi metrics. This ensures
  efficient data retrieval, better dApp performance, and improved transparency across XRAY/Network. Access to advanced
  features is available through paid plans, payable in ADA or XRAY tokens.

- Additionally, XRAY/Network is built utilizing CardanoWeb3Js, a JavaScript library that simplifies interaction with the Cardano blockchain. CardanoWeb3Js powers core functions such as wallet connectivity, transaction building, signing, and blockchain data retrieval. By integrating this library, XRAY/Network provides developers with a robust toolkit to create seamless user experiences and build advanced decentralized applications on Cardano.

- Completing the ecosystem, XRAY/Foundation serves as a dedicated organization focused on supporting the growth, development, and sustainability of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Cardano blockchain. XRAY/Foundation is committed to funding open-source initiatives, empowering developers, and fostering community-driven projects that expand the Cardano DeFi landscape. Its mission is to accelerate innovation, promote accessibility, and ensure the long-term success of XRAY/Network and the broader Cardano ecosystem by supporting research, education, grants, and strategic partnerships.

## XRAY/Network Goals

As a foundational ecosystem built on the Cardano blockchain, XRAY/Network is committed to driving innovation, accessibility, and growth within the decentralized finance space. Our goals reflect our mission to empower users, developers, and communities while supporting the long-term sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.

We focus on the following key objectives:
