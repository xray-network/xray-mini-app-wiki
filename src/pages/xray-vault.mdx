# XRAY/Vault

XRAY/Vault is a secure transaction signing solution designed to enhance control and protection over blockchain interactions within the Cardano ecosystem. It allows users to remotely sign transactions through the XRAY/Vault app while keeping private keys safely stored on their local device. This ensures that sensitive data is never exposed — making it an ideal choice for both individual users and organizations looking for high-security standards in managing digital assets and on-chain operations.

XRAY/Vault is built to be modular and developer-friendly, offering a JavaScript framework that allows seamless integration into third-party dApps, wallets, and enterprise tools. This means external applications can delegate signing responsibilities to XRAY/Vault without handling or storing private keys themselves, significantly reducing security risks and simplifying compliance.

By supporting remote approvals, XRAY/Vault helps streamline transaction workflows while maintaining strong cryptographic safeguards. Its flexibility and integration-ready architecture make it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from simple wallet operations to complex multi-user or institutional environments.
