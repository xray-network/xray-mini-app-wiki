# XRAY/App

XRAY/App is a cutting-edge DeFi ecosystem built on the Cardano blockchain, designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and available as both mobile and desktop applications. It delivers a comprehensive suite of tools for managing digital assets, staking, trading, and exploring decentralized finance — all within a seamless, secure, and scalable environment.

What sets XRAY/App apart is its extensibility through Mini Apps — a powerful feature that allows developers to create and integrate custom applications directly into the platform. Mini Apps run in secure iframes, enabling a wide range of additional functionalities such as financial tools, games, governance modules, or community features. This modular approach ensures XRAY/App can continuously evolve and adapt to user needs, unlocking endless possibilities for expansion.

XRAY/App is built utilizing CardanoWeb3js, a JavaScript library designed to simplify interaction with the Cardano blockchain. By leveraging CardanoWeb3Js, XRAY/App enables seamless wallet connectivity, transaction building, signing, and blockchain data retrieval — providing developers with a robust foundation for creating advanced decentralized applications and delivering a smooth user experience.

## Key Features

With a strong focus on technological innovation and a user-first experience, XRAY/App empowers users, creators, and developers to thrive in a dynamic DeFi environment. The ecosystem is built to remain flexible and future-proof, driving adoption and enabling the next generation of decentralized applications.
