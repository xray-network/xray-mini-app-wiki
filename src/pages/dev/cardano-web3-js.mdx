# CardanoWeb3.js

CardanoWeb3js is a versatile TypeScript library designed for seamless integration with the Cardano blockchain. It supports both Node.js and browser environments, streamlining transaction creation, smart contract deployment, and data exploration. Ideal for developers, this toolkit simplifies Cardano cryptographic operations and API interactions.

This library is a set of abstractions over various opensource libraries and SDKs that are required to work with the Cardano blockchain: CML by dcSpark, MSL by Emurgo, UPLC by Aiken, Plutus Data by Spacebudz, and other.

Building an SDK is always a compromise between functionality, ease of code understanding, and modularity. We think we've managed to find the middle ground on this one. We believe that you will enjoy the ease of working with CW3js! ✨
